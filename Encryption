$The CIA Triad, model? Confidential, integrity, availability
$CIA> confidentiality? refers to: data confidentiality, personal privacy; protect against unauthorized disclosure of information; counter measure: authentication, cyrptography and other
$CIA> Integrity? refers to: data integrity, system integrity, source integrity (authenticity, nonrepudiation);protect against data alteration (modification, destruction), unexpected
system behaviour & repudiation; counter measure: authentication, AV SW, cryptography, other
$CIA> Availability? refers to: timely access to services; protect against denial of service attacks; counter measure: access control, cryptography, other
$What are the components of cryptography? plaintext, cipher, Key, Ciphertext
$Cryptography> plaintext? data to be encrypted
$Cryptography> Cipher? algorithm public domain to encrypt or decrypt
$Cryptography> Key? Secret ingredient
$Cryptography> ciphertext? Encrypted data
$Cryptography> Encrypted message? data confidentiality
$Cryptography> message authentication codes? (MAC, HMAC) [data integrity]
$Cryptography> digital signature? source integrity
