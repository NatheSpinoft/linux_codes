Your VMware machine: setup of two network adapters

Verify VMWare Network settings: In the VMware Virtual Network Settings verifythat one VMnet
is associated with NAT and will share the Internet (on most laptopsthis is the wireless card)
and the other VMnet is bridged to the onboard physicalnetwork card: this card has to be
connected to the RED network which is a closed.

Verify VMware machines settings: Verify that each of your virtual machines hasthe two Ethernet 
adapters described above added to the hardware configuration. Ifnot, add missing VMNets. Verify
that both network adapters in each virtual machineare “custom linked” to the VMnets set up in
the Virtual Network Editor: Typically wemake the first network adapter the “Blue” network (internet),
and the second net-work adapter to the “Red” network.

The account name is user8213 and the password is user8213.
useradd user8213
passwd user8213

Make the user an “administrator” which adds the user to the “wheel” group facili-tating sudo (root access)
usermod -aG wheel user8213

Disable the NetworkManager service.
systemctl disable NetworkManager.service
systemctl stop NetworkManager.service



Enable the network service.
oVerify the runlevel status of the network service & turn it on if necessary:
chkconfig –-list network;
chkconfig --level 345 network on




verify the service status of the network service
systemctl status network; service network status
  turnit down and up
    ifdown ens##
    ifup ens##


turn it on if necessary
systemctl start network (and enable it if necessary)

lspci –v diskplays kernel drivers in use
lsmod output displays driver is loaded thought verification
